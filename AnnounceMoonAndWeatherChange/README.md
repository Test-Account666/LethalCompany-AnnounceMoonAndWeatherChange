# Announce Moon And Weather Changes Mod<br>

This mod shows which moon the ship just routed to.<br>

It also shows a weather warning.<br>

Credit goes
to [Beepsterr's AnnounceMoonChange](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Beepsterr/AnnounceMoonChange/), since
that's where the idea came from.<br>

Now... You probably wonder: "How is your mod any different from Beepsterr's mod?"<br>
Good question! The differences are:<br>

- Support for WeatherTweaks' unknown/uncertain conditions<br>
- Weather warning after ship reaches orbit<br>
- Waits for spawn animation to finish before notifying you when you just entered the lobby<br>
- Configurable messages<br>
- Ability to disable weather warning or moon change announcement<br>
- Different animations for the weather warning<br>

**NOTE:** [mrov's WeatherTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrov/WeatherTweaks/) is supported! :)<br>
(Other mods doing similar things may not work as expected)
